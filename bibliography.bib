  abstract  = {It is shown that any recognition problem solved by a polynomial time-bounded nondeterministic Turing machine can be “reduced” to the problem of determining whether a given propositional formula is a tautology. Here “reduced” means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

  abstract = {Two algorithms for the k-satisfiability problem are presented and a probabilistic analysis is performed. The analysis is based on an instance distribution which is parametrized to simulate a variety of sample characteristics. The algorithms assign values to literals appearing in a given instance of k-satisfiability, one at a time, until a solution is found or it is discovered that further assignments cannot lead to finding a solution. One algorithm chooses the next literal from a unit clause if one exists and randomly from the set of remaining literals otherwise. The other algorithm uses a generalization of the unit-clause rule as a heuristic for selecting the next literal: at each step a literal is chosen randomly from a clause containing the least number of literals. The algorithms run in polynomial time and it is shown that they find a solution to a random instance of k-satisfiability with probability bounded below by a constant greater than zero for two different ranges of parameter values. It is also shown that the second algorithm mentioned finds a solution with probability approaching one for a wide range of parameter values.}

  abstract = {Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving is one of the most competitive research areas of theoretical computer science. The performance of state-of-the-art SAT solvers has been continuously improving in the last decades and has reached a level where SAT solvers can be employed to solve real world problems in fields such as hardware and software verification, automated planning and many others. One of the important driving forces of this progress are the yearly organized (since 2002) SAT competitions. In this paper we describe the 2015 SAT Race that featured the traditional sequential and parallel tracks (with 64 core computers) and introduced the Incremental Library Track, which is particularly interesting for developers of SAT based applications. We describe the 2015 SAT Race and provide a detailed analysis of its results.}

This will allow users of SAT-solvers to make domain specific extensions or adaptions of current state-of-the-art SAT-techniques, to meet the needs of a particular application area. The presented solver is designed with this in mind, and includes among other things a mechanism for adding arbitrary boolean constraints. It also supports solving a series of related SAT-problems efficiently by an incremental SAT-interface.},
