\chapter*{Abstract}

SAT solvers play an important role in many formal verification and reasoning systems, often serving as the reasoning core for more complex tools like SMT solvers. Such applications often demand a more fine-grained interaction with SAT solvers that goes beyond simple incremental SAT solving interface like IPASIR. IPASIR-UP extends IPASIR interface, enabling more control from user applications on the SAT solvers, but it has been so far only implemented on CaDiCaL, therefore, its practicality and capabilities are yet to be fully demonstrated. This thesis introduces MiniSatUP, an adaptation of  the well-established SAT solver, MiniSat, to the IPASIR-UP interface, supporting user-guided decision, propagation and clause addition during solving while emphasizing minimal disruption to the original architecture of MiniSat. As the second IPASIR-UP implementation after CaDiCaL, MiniSatUP demonstrates the feasibility of extending mature SAT solvers with IPASIR-UP, and its integration with SMT solver cvc5 confirms the interface's practicality and validates IPASIR-UP as a potential standard for integrating SAT solvers into modern applications.
