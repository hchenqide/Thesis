\chapter*{Abstract}

SAT solvers play an important role in many formal verification and reasoning systems, often serving as the reasoning core for more complex tools like SMT solvers. Such applications often demand a more fine-grained interaction with SAT solvers that goes beyond simple incremental SAT solving interface like IPASIR. IPASIR-UP extends IPASIR interface, enabling more control from user applications on the SAT solvers, but it has so far only been implemented on CaDiCaL, therefore its practicality and capabilities are yet to be fully demonstrated. This thesis introduces MiniSatUP, an adaptation of the IPASIR-UP interface for the well-established SAT solver, MiniSat, supporting user-guided decision, propagation and clause addition during solving while emphasizing minimal disruption to the original architecture. As the second IPASIR-UP implementation after CaDiCaL, MiniSatUP demonstrates the feasibility of extending mature SAT solvers with IPASIR-UP. And its integration with SMT solver cvc5 confirms the interface's practicality and validates IPASIR-UP as a potential stardard for integrating SAT solvers into mordern applications.
