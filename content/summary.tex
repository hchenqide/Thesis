\chapter{Summary and Future Work}

In this work, we extended MiniSat with the IPASIR-UP interface, resulting in MiniSatUP, and integrated it with cvc5. As the second implementation of IPASIR-UP after CaDiCaL, it demonstrates the practicality of integrating IPASIR-UP in modern SAT solvers for achieving a more fine-grained collaboration with user applications, and displays no performance overhead.

Possible future work would be:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Investigating the remaining failed and timeout cases in cvc5 integration with MiniSatUP.
  \item Extending IPASIR-UP interface to support the CaDiCaL-specific functions like termination, learned clause and fixed variable notification, and also to support resolution proof.
  \item Further abstracting and simplifying the SAT solver interface in cvc5 with IPASIR-UP.
  \item Supporting proof validation in IDRUP format for MiniSatUP.
  \item Developing and optimizing MiniSatUP with chronological backtracking.
\end{itemize}
